## Module 1: iPhone Data Analysis Project
I started with a hands-on project analyzing iPhone data. This project helped me get comfortable with Python and understand basic data transformation and analysis techniques.

## Module 2: Python Basics
I built a strong foundation in Python by learning the basics:
- Worked with strings and numbers
- Understood different data types
- Explored Python data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- Practiced using loops and conditional statements

## Module 3: Python Intermediate
I delved into intermediate concepts to strengthen my programming skills:
- Learned about list comprehensions
- Explored Python packages and how to use them
- Practiced exception handling
- Worked with text files and functions
- Got introduced to lambda functions

## Module 4: Python Advance
I tackled advanced topics and packages commonly used in data engineering:
- Studied the Numpy package for numerical operations
- Learned about the Pandas package for data manipulation and analysis

## Module 5: Python for Data Engineering
I focused on Python's applications in data engineering, learning how to work with different file formats and handle DateTime columns:
- Worked with DateTime formats
- Managed various file formats like JSON, CSV, Excel, and AVRO
- Scraped Amazon data using Python
