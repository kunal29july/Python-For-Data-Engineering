## Note
In my current organization, I am working on a Python tech stack using FastAPI and also collaborating with the data analytics team. Therefore, I was comfortable with the topics covered. However, if you are new to these concepts, you may need to spend a good amount of time to get up to speed. 🕒

## Module 1: iPhone Data Analysis Project 📱
I started with a hands-on project analyzing iPhone data. This project helped me get comfortable with Python and understand basic data transformation and analysis techniques. 📊

## Module 2: Python Basics 🐍
I built a strong foundation in Python by learning the basics:
- 📝 Worked with strings and numbers
- 🔢 Understood different data types
- 📚 Explored Python data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- 🔄 Practiced using loops and conditional statements

## Module 3: Python Intermediate 📈
I delved into intermediate concepts to strengthen my programming skills:
- 🧩 Learned about list comprehensions
- 📦 Explored Python packages and how to use them
- ⚠️ Practiced exception handling
- 📂 Worked with text files and functions
- 🔍 Got introduced to lambda functions

## Module 4: Python Advance 🚀
I tackled advanced topics and packages commonly used in data engineering:
- 🔢 Studied the Numpy package for numerical operations
- 🐼 Learned about the Pandas package for data manipulation and analysis

## Module 5: Python for Data Engineering 🛠️
I focused on Python's applications in data engineering, learning how to work with different file formats and handle DateTime columns:
- 🕒 Worked with DateTime formats
- 📂 Managed various file formats like JSON, CSV, Excel, and AVRO
- 🛒 Scraped Amazon data using Python

## Module 6: Spotify Data Pipeline End-To-End Python Data Engineering Project 🎵
Implemented a complete data pipeline project using Spotify:
- 🎧 Integrated with Spotify API and extracted data
- 🚀 Deployed code on AWS Lambda for data extraction
- ⏰ Added triggers to run the extraction automatically
- 🔄 Wrote transformation functions
- 🛠️ Built automated triggers on transformation functions
- 📂 Stored files on S3 properly
- 📊 Built analytics tables on data files using Glue and Athena
